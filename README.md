# Automate the Boring Stuff Demo

Demo repository using GitHub Actions and pre-commit.ci to demonstrate how to automate the linting, formatting and testing with CI systems!

## What is this all about?

This repository is part of the demo session from my talk [Automating the boring stuff](https://r0x0d.github.io/talks/slides/automate-the-boring-stuff/#/) gave at Red Hat in the Learn Python initiative.
